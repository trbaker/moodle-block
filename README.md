# Moodle-block

This code doesn't include an installer.  To use with Moodle, you'll need to manually add itno your Moodle file structure as a folder called "simplehtml" in the blocks folder.  My local file path looks something like:

 local path
 /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/moodle311/blocks/simplehtml
 
 The code herin in based on the blocks tutorial at:
 https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Main_Page
